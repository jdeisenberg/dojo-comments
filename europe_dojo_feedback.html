<dt>Did you experience any difficulties with the tools (bsb, merlin, editor plugins, etc)?</dt>
<dd><div>yes! 1. often the editor would not reflect the current compiler state, still displaying errors that were not real; 2. refmt sometimes didn't work for unknown reasons</div></dd>
<dt>Did you find any error messages hard to follow? If so, which ones?</dt>

<dd><div></div></dd>
<dt>What did you like about the experience?</dt>
<dd><div>The community aspect, I loved that results became visible for everyone on the map and that much of the groundwork like POSTing and GETting has been done for you.</div><div></div><div>Regarding the toolchain, sometimes you get tripped up by the UNKNOWN SYNTAX ERROR, but otherwise it's been ok.</div></dd>
<dt>What did you dislike about the experience?</dt>
<dd><div>Array vs List, always using Array when interacting with JavaScript is not explicitly mentioned in the docs. I think it's mentioned, but in between the lines.</div><div></div><div>I probably missed something, but the shadowing part of type name vs parameter name tripped us up in the beginning and it wasn't perfectly clear why that's the case.</div></dd>
<dt>Where did the team spend the most time?</dt>
<dd><div>Writing bindings, shadowing.</div></dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><div></div></dd>
<dt>Did you experience any difficulties with the tools (bsb, merlin, editor plugins, etc)?</dt>
<dd><div>Nope, has been quite lovely this time around!</div></dd>
<dt>Did you find any error messages hard to follow? If so, which ones?</dt>
<dd><div>UNKNOWN SYNTAX ERROR</div></dd>
<dt>Anything in particular you wish would have been better documented?</dt>
<dd><div>In the concrete case where the response body string =&gt; JSON =&gt; Reason records conversion is taking place. I know it's in the Fetcher, but after ReasonConf I thought I'd always have to use `Json.Decode` or `location##username` etc.</div><div></div><div>I guess part of it was that the Fetcher was supposed to be a blackbox anyway and from the type definition it was clear that we already get records.</div><div></div><div>Another thing was https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/element-type-is-invalid.html which is documented, but it also tripped us up. I'm not sure if the tooling can improve this, but it would be nice.</div></dd>
<dt>What would you change in the ecosystem to make it better?</dt>
<dd><div>More bindings for popular libraries publicly available and community maintained. But this is a community effort anyway. But since we spent a lot of time writing bindings, this would be the best thing to have.</div></dd>
<dt>What would you like to build or learn for your next Dojo?</dt>
<dd><div>Typed server code. Maybe form validation. Nothing where I have to write a UI myself :D</div><div></div><div>That's also a big plus for this dojo, the styles were already defined.</div></dd>

<dd><div>the autocomplete, the reducerComponent, no need for imports &lt;3, the fact that the language has refmt &lt;3 (no need to engage in big fights about who has the better style :D)</div></dd>
<dt>What did you dislike about the experience?</dt>
<dd><div>That for some reason in my mind reason is close to javascript when it's really not.</div><div>Writting the binding for the react-simple-maps was a big pain for me as beginner. </div><div>Also the doc for someone that is not used to read functionnal programming documentation,  it is not very easy.</div><div>The ~ is not the best on a non US keyboard. </div><div>ReactDOMRe.Style.make(~width="100%", ~maxWidth="980px", ~margin="0 auto", ())) that kind of code is painful to write, I wish the compiler could add the last param () automatically.</div><div>[0, 20] vs [|(0), (20)|] as javascript developer I would have prefered if the first one was the array and not the list :D </div><div></div></dd>

<dt>Anything in particular you wish would have been better documented?</dt>
<dd><div>interop, it was not easy to find how to write </div><div>[@bs.module "react-simple-maps"]</div><div>external geographies: ReasonReact.reactClass = "Geographies";</div></dd>
<dt>What would you change in the ecosystem to make it better?</dt>
<dd><div>As a react developer I would say the availability of interop for most mainstream library. I have the general feeling that TypeScript is more popular than flow just because they have a huge typings community.</div></dd>
<dt>What would you like to build or learn for your next Dojo?</dt>

<dt>What did you dislike about the experience?</dt>
<dd><div>The format could've been a little bit more specific in terms of hints. There's a few 'gotchas' which were very hard to find out. (like shadowing type names)</div></dd>

<dt></dt>

<dd><div>Just some vague error messages sometimes. When shadowing, or a syntax error</div></dd>
<dt>Did you find any error messages hard to follow? If so, which ones?</dt>
<dd><div>The error message when a type with @bs-derive annotation has the same name as it's parent property</div></dd>
<dt>Anything in particular you wish would have been better documented?</dt>
<dd><div>There are some language features, like the different pipe operators '|&gt;' vs '|.'</div></dd>

<dd><div>Very helpful mentors! Opportunity to learn something new</div></dd>
<dt>What did you dislike about the experience?</dt>
<dd><div>I think there should be requirement for each participant in a dojo to spend at least 15minutes studying Reason/BS docs before attending. I think it's very frustrating (not talking about myself, but my teammates) for people hopping into the dojo not having previously read at least about basic Reason types and BS annotations.</div></dd>

<dt>Anything in particular you wish would have been better documented?</dt>
<dd><div>Event participation prerequisities - as I said, I would like participants to have at least read about Reason types and BS annotations at least a little before attending.</div></dd>

<dd><div>Pascal, C, C++, Java, C#, Golang, Haskell, OCaml, Elm</div></dd>

<dd><div>Clojure, Haskell, OCaml, Elm</div></dd>
<dt>What did you like about the experience?</dt>
<dd><div>The dojo task was interesting because it had a couple of different subtasks so that you could choose one and jump in the deep end. </div></dd>
<dt>What did you dislike about the experience?</dt>
<dd><div>Not having any particular JS or React experience (besides what I've gathered from reading off the web and staying up to date), it was frustrating that the tasks were more about React than about Reason itself.</div></dd>
<dt>Where did the team spend the most time?</dt>
<dd><div>Figuring out how to interop Reason and React</div></dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd><div>Option 1</div></dd>
<dt>Did you experience any difficulties with the tools (bsb, merlin, editor plugins, etc)?</dt>
<dd><div>No, they worked surprisingly well.</div></dd>
<dt>Did you find any error messages hard to follow? If so, which ones?</dt>
<dd><div>Yes, the message about undefined field (because you had forgotten to open the containing module) was not too obvious. To my surprise we didn't get any error message at all when we tried to do List.map instead of Array.map. It actually worked, but produced the wrong result. </div></dd>
<dt>Anything in particular you wish would have been better documented?</dt>
<dd><div></div></dd>
<dt>What would you change in the ecosystem to make it better?</dt>
<dd><div>I can't really tell yet. I feel like the documentation overall is quite good, but plenty of knowledge of React seems to be expected. That's fine of course as long as there's a big label somewhere warning the reader so that they know that they need to check other sources too.</div><div></div><div>As with any fairly new language it was difficult to find answers to questions that were not discussed in the documentation. Surely the situation will improve over time.</div></dd>
<dt>What would you like to build or learn for your next Dojo?</dt>
